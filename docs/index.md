Tips for proper orchid care:

- Place your orchid in south or east facing windows.
- Over-watering will lead the roots to rot, add an ice cube every other day and allow for proper drainage.
- Only Phalaenopsis (the moth orchid) will rebloom from an old spike.


## History Exists for a Reason

The importance of social memory cannot be overstated.

> Forgetting extermination is part of extermination, because it is also the extermination of memory, of history, of the social, etc. This forgetting is as essential as the event in any case unlocatable by us, inaccessible to us in its truth. This forgetting is still too dangerous, it must be effaced by an artificial memory (today, everywhere, it is artificial memories that effect the memory of man, that efface man in his own memory). This artificial memory will be the restaging of extermination - but late, much too late for it to be able to make real waves and profoundly disturb something, and especially, especially through medium that is itself cold, radiating forgetfulness, deterrence, and extermination in a still more systematic way, if that is possible, than the camps themselves.
